** My name is Deep. I work for an MNC as Test Architect for 12+ years.** 
I always wanted to learn new things & for that decided to learn Data Science.
I am actually grabbing different resources for myself & thought of creating this repo sometime back to help others who are very new to DS.
The resources collected are completely freely available in the internet and they are for self-learning only.
Please go through each & every file/folder/pdfs & I am sure these will be helpful for you guys.
All the best !! 
Happy Learning..
